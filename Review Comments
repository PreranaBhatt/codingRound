I have created basic POM framework which contains :
codingRound.Pages - contains locators or WebElement and reusable function based on functionality.

CodingRoundTestscript-contains End to end Flows created with the help of reusable function.

CodingRoundUtility: it contains frequently used reusable function

Error fixed:

@findBy should be in page object class,as it got initialized by lazy intialization.
driver = new chromeDriver
before this statement we should call System.setproperty function.

for Login : iframe is present in Login Page.
			First ,we need to switch iframe,then only we would be able to perform any operation on webelement.

Suggestion for DatePicker.
In given code,datePicker is hardcoded.

It's xpath should be dynamic in nature.where we can provide any date,based on that it should click.
or system can generate random date to pick.
